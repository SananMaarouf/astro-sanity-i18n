## 🏢 Sanity Studio & CLI Setup

This project uses [Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io/).  
To create an organization, initialize a project, and deploy your Sanity Studio, use the included npm scripts.

### Common Setup Steps

1. **Login to Sanity:**
   ```bash
   npm run sanity:login
   ```
2. **Create a new organization (optional):**
   ```bash
   npm run sanity:create-org -- --name "<your-org-name>"
   ```
3. **Initialize a new project or select an existing one:**
   ```bash
   npm run sanity:init
   ```
   Follow the prompts to choose your organization and dataset.

4. **Deploy your Sanity Studio:**
   ```bash
   npm run sanity:deploy
   ```
   This will give you a public Studio URL.

> **Note:**  
> The Sanity Studio code should be in a `/studio` folder or as a separate app.

## ⚡ Environment Setup

This template uses environment variables for your Sanity project credentials.  
Your actual `.env` file is **not** included in version control (see `.gitignore`).  
To get started, **create your own `.env` file** in the project root, using `.env.example` as a reference:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, fill in your Sanity project ID and dataset in `.env`:

```env
PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="your sanity project id here"
PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"
```

**Note:**  
Your `.env` file is required for local development and building your site!

## 🏁 Get Started

This template is designed to be cloned and customized for your own projects.  
Swap out your Sanity credentials, update your schemas, and start building—no boilerplate required!
